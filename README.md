# Biogeographic and spatial drivers of predatory fish assemblages on isolated seamount reefs in the Coral Sea

This repository houses code for analysing changes in predatory fish communities with depth on a number of remote seamount reefs in the Coral Sea. Spatial scales are 1000km+ in latitude and 350km offshore/shelf gradient. Reef sizes vary from very large (Lihou/Tregrosse Reefs >23kha outer reef area) to relatively small (Bougainvill/Herald's Surprise <2kha outer reef area). Isolation levels also varied and a buffer measure used to quantify these. See the relevant scripts for more information.

The data used in this project are taken from 538 ROV transects conducted on these reefs between in 2021 and 2023, ranging in depth from surface to 100m. 

Note that raw data are housed in a repository (FigShare), currently referenced in wrangling code and this repo is currently in draft state. Upon finalisation of this analysis, data will be made public with a final DOI and the code updated (as @ 20240624)
